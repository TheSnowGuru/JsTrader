### ðŸš€ JsTraderApi

The **JsTraderApi** is a powerful connection/interface that bridges your JavaScript strategies with MT4/5 terminals. This functionality is analogous to our well-known **Pytrader_API**, which is widely used by many strategies coded in Python. 

In addition to the JsTraderApi, an **Expert Advisor (EA)** is required for both MT4 and MT5 terminals, and these are included as part of the system. The demo version offers full functionality for the following instruments: 

- **EURUSD**
- **AUDCHF**
- **NZDCHF**
- **GBPNZD**
- **USDCAD**
- **DAX** (added as an index instrument in the demo)

ðŸ“„ **Documentation**  
The functionality is thoroughly documented in a PDF file.

### ðŸ”§ Requirements

- A running **MT4 or MT5 terminal**.
- The appropriate EA must be active on at least one chart.
- Fill in the socket server port and, for the licensed version, the folder with the authentication indicator.
- The demo version is fully functional for the mentioned instruments, and the authentication indicator can be acquired via [MQL5 Markets](https://www.mql5.com).

### âš¡ Performance

The socket communication is **very fast** (interrupt-based), ensuring efficient execution. The execution time of functions depends on the specific function and the selected broker. The MT terminal acts as a server while the JsTraderApi acts as a client, facilitating a question-and-answer interaction.
